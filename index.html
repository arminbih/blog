                obsession began. It was mostly because of games. But actually my love of technology goes further back
                when
                I got my first gaming console. It was a knock-off Nintendo Famicom, and called <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ending-Man_Terminator" class="content-a">Terminator.</a> It
                almost never worked without problems and had an adapter that could last for a whole two hours before
                frying itself. The Chinese were not known for their quality products back then...

            <p>Now that we now the reason for this technological obsession let's continue. After breaking around a
                hundred controllers playing Mario Bros, and countless other popular titles which I can't even remember
                now, in a few years the age of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ending-Man_Terminator"
                    class="content-a">Terminator</a> was over. Couple of my friends including me started getting their
                first PC's. They were mostly IBM's with pentium 3 processors (the lucky ones had pentium 4's) and big
                bulky CRT monitors. My main concern once I got my hands on one, despite all the educational
                possibilities, was how to get some games to run. Most of the PC's then ran Windows 98, and let me tell
                you it was a real challenge getting that first game to run. But oh what a game it was.

                just that. Technological obsession.

                For a better part of my life I did not really know what I
                want to do. With life in general. But I guess that's normal, and you could probably say that for every
                adolescent. Especially adolescents of that time, our time... After all we were the<a class="content-a"
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=90%27s%20kid"> 90s kids.</a>
                As I am now reflecting on this period there comes to mind a lot of mixed memories and feelings. The joys
                of youth are plenty but so are the sorrows. <a class="content-a"

                Another factor that contributed to that confusion is war. The country had gone through a rough period of
                internal conflict and it got ugly fast. Now you can imagine (or perhaps you can't) that post war period
                and all the merits it brought. Let's just say that kids were not the only ones who were confused. I've
                always had a lot of <strong>passion in doing anything that I love</strong> ever since I was a kid.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was probably the most stubborn child of all the kids. When I got a hold of something, an idea, I
                just would not let go. I would go to the absolute extremes with it. I can't stress enough that this
                is not a good thing, no matter what anyone says. Having passion for <em>something</em> is great it
                is what pushes you forward, but if you are not able to control it and slow down, you will burn out
                fast.
            </p>
            <p>
                School wasn't really my thing. Even in kindergarten I struggled with following sleeping rules and such.
                I believe the mind wants to be free always. My child self could not understand why we must follow all
                these rules. I just wanted to be free to do what I want. If I didn't like something I would leave it.
                I was like this always, even those early days. So what did I do? I left. And I left every day no
                matter how hard they tried to stop me. Whenever I felt like I had enough of kindergarten and all the
                other kids there was <strong>no door that could stop me.</strong>

                That was the first time I learned something about myself. Besides being different, I was incredibly
                resourceful. Those kindergarten teachers really had a hard time keeping me in.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't remember having friends that early in life. What I remember is that I could not rely on anyone,
                especially in my escapes. Kids are the ultimate competition to each other. Every time I would confess
                any detail of my plan to any of the other kids they would always rat me out to the teacher, and I would
                find myself having to resort to some other clever way of deception. You would think that this kind of
                early exposure to society would work to your benefit and help you later in life. It might, but that
                wasn't the case for me, because everything I do I do the hard way and multiple times.
                Every period of our lives has a distinct feel to it. It is almost as if we are different people at
                different times.

            <p>
                When I hit school it was another ball game entirely. When I say hit I mean it. For me it was like the
                end of the world. School was a lot more serious and everyone tried really hard to pound it into my head.
                No more childish behavior, no clever escapes, and you have to put a lot of time in it. The time part I
                didn't really understand, because what was time to a child? I had loads of it and always only wanted the
                sun to set a little slower. That first day in school I learned that one day can last a lifetime. That
                first day was longer than all of my years combined up to that point.

                of first real friendships.

            <p>
                We have a saying here. A living man will adjust to anything. It is somewhat true, but there is another
                part to this saying, a part that is left out. Thinking more clearly about it, maybe it should go like
                this: "A living man will adjust
                to anything, but at a cost". Sometimes this cost is too high. The ultimate price. We were told this to
                ease our pain of adjusting but we were never told the price of it. Like the fine print of terms and
                conditions the important part was buried somewhere only to be found when it is too late. It was in <span
                    class="small-print">small print</span>. If
                we new about the price maybe we would not accept to adjust. Maybe we wanted to stay who we were. By
                accepting the change if it is big enough and adjusting to it we become a different person.
            </p>
            <p>
                School became barrable after making a few friends. As still kids we did what kids do, had fun running
                around making all kinds of trouble. Soon all was forgotten and the effects of adjustment were fading.
                Time cures all wounds they say, at least the ones we can't see. Soon the lessons learned earlier were
                forgotten. Life was careless again.

                In school I did well without really understanding the why. Why was I forced to learn these things is a
                question that was hanging over my head. I lacked the concept of future sort to say. I could never in my
                wildest dreams have accepted that all that knowledge would be beneficial to me in some way. I remembered
                easy what I deemed worthy. But my brain has an unusual characteristic. It remembers exclusively the
                things that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099864/" target="blank" style="color: #f44336
                ">IT</a> wants.

                The struggle I have with my brain really reminds me of a struggle with a monster. A carefree, always the

            <p> We meet with a lot of injustice throughout our life, but injustice can be only a
                matter of perspective. What might seem like injustice for prey is a matter of survival to a predator. If
                only it was that easy. We humans tend to complicate things, even the small things. So actions and words
                from other people that
                some only brush off as insignificant, or give no second thought to, might hit hard for other more
                sensitive people. I might go as far as to say it affects the development of their personality,
                especially in early years. It doesn't seem fair that some people are better equipped to deal with the
                pressure of life. Is it an evolutionary trait? Coping with every day
                pressure of school and growing up would take a lot of energy out of me. At the end of the day I had
                hardly any left.

                Survival of the fittest in today's world means being able to adapt fast. If you are faster to get to a
                correct conclusion, and then use that to your benefit, you are the winner. I pride myself in saying I've
                had a lot of hobbies in my life. Some might say even too many. I have accepted this trait of mine, as my
                brain always looks for new things to do. As one <span style="color:#f9e79f;">legend wait for it dairy
                    man</span>
                has said: "I only have one rule and that is <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother_(season_6)" target="blank">new is
                    always better"</a>. And I can even picture my brain working by this principle, jumping around from
                one thing to another. Sometimes completely and utterly forgetting the previous thing it was so
                fascinated
                with.

                    Zar vise vlastita misao u ovom svijetu i ima smisla. Zar nije sve vec istrazeno, receno, ura]eno?
                    Zasto uopste pokusati kada vec postoje oni koji su ili su bili najbolji... pisci, sportisti,
                    umjetnici. Kako se izdvojiti iz svog tog kršlusa? Zar smo izgubili vrijednost, zar smo kroz ucenje
                    o silnim teoremama izgubili vlastitu misao, zar samo znamo ponavljati, kopirati i pitati se.

                    To try to feel what you have once felt is to fall into darkness. Knowing u might never be who you
                    once were is a hole many don't crawl out of. <strong>Perpetual darkness</strong> Who I was do I
                    really remember? does it really matter anymore. There is darkness on both sides. It is also there if
                    we can't become who we think we are. All of our fears wishes, desires, insecurities are
                    there... on one side or the other. We are only human. Well not all of us. Those with a hearth.
